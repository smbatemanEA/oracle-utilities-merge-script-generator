The Generalized Data Export (GDE)  file contains information about the Maintenance Object (MO) along with the exported data pertaining to that MO, in JSON format. 
Below is a sample record format of the export file:

{
"OBJ": "<Specifies the MO Name>",
"TIMESTAMP": "<The time of export in ISO format for example 2019-07-25T11:06:04.740615Z>",
"PK1": "<Maintenance Object’s pk1 value>",
"PK2": "< Maintenance Object’s pk2 value if any>",
"PK3": "< Maintenance Object’s pk3 value if any>",
"PK4": "< Maintenance Object’s pk4 value if any>",
"PK5": "< Maintenance Object’s pk5 value if any>",
"DELETED": true,
"DATA":
{
"<Maintenance Object’s table name 1>":
[
{<name value pairs of all fields in row 1 in that table>},
{<name value pairs of all fields in row 2 in that table>},...
{<name value pairs of all fields in row n in that table>},...
],
"< Maintenance Object’s table name 2>":
[
{<name value pairs of all fields in row 1 in that table>},
{<name value pairs of all fields in row 2 in that table>},...
{<name value pairs of all fields in row n in that table>}
],...
"< Maintenance Object’s table name n>":
[
{<name value pairs of all fields in row 1 in that table>},
{<name value pairs of all fields in row 2 in that table>},...
{<name value pairs of all fields in row n in that table>}
] }


In the export file, the DELETED indicator is included only if the MO has been deleted and null values in tables are exported as empty strings.
